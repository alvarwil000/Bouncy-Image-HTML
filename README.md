# ToDo list:

-Add sound when the DVD/image bounces
 
 Might make this optional/toggleable by pressing M (Mute)

-Make it so when your dragging the image it actually applies velocity instead of just modifying the position

-Time scale modifier when the user presses up/down arrows on the keyboard in 0.25 increments

The current time scale toggles when the user presses T so you can view it in the top left corner for as long as the user need to
